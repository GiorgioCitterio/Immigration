<p>Interviewer: Very interesting. Why did you decide to emigrate to the United States?</p>
<p>Emigrant: I decided to emigrate to the United States because I wanted a fresh start and greater job opportunities. Also, I had always dreamed of living in a foreign country and experiencing new cultures.</p>
<p>Interviewer: I see. How was your experience adapting to life in the United States?</p>

<p>Interviewer: What are the main cultural differences you&apos;ve noticed between the United States and Italy?</p>
<p>Emigrant: One of the main differences I&apos;ve noticed is the work mentality. In the United States, there is a strong work culture and most people work very hard. In Italy, on the other hand, social And family life is very important. Additionally, I&apos;ve noticed that the cuisine is very different. In the United States, there are many fast food and prepared foods, while in Italy the cuisine is much more traditional and based on fresh ingredients.</p>
<p>Interviewer: What do you miss most about Italy?</p>
